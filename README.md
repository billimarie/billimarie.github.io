# Values

🌱 Regeneration over extraction

🧭 Intuition as a valid form of intelligence

🧠 Systems thinking & long-term stewardship

🎨 Art as infrastructure for meaning

👩‍👧 Future generations first

🌍 Place-based, climate-aware design

I actively seek out dissenting views, blind spots, and critiques — not to weaken ideas, but to strengthen them.
